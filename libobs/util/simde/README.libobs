This is a slightly modified version of the simde directory in
https://github.com/simd-everywhere/simde/commit/71fd833d9666141edcd1d3c109a80e228303d8d7

Modifications:
1. Unused files have removed.
2. The code was reformatted using the supplied .clang-format.
3. Functions implementing _mm_loadu_epi{8,16,32,64}() were removed due to failing MacOS build.
